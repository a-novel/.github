# AI usage

This is generic documentation about AI usage across A-Novel repositories.

Using AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) is allowed. They can significantly speed up development when used
appropriately. However, AI-generated code is still **your responsibility** — you own it, you maintain it, you debug it.

## Core Principles

_We want AI code, not AI slop code_

- **Skills are yours, not AI**: a bad coder will produce bad code, with or without AI assistance. We expect all
  the code you produce to be your own, i.e. code that you fully understand down to the smallest detail. If your output
  is not worth more than AI, your participation is worthless to us (we already have AI at home).
- **Never generate code you can't review**: we don't enforce any rules about the scope of AI assistance. Generating
  basic code, test suites, or drafting more complex logic are all valid use cases. However, the rules that apply to
  human-written code also apply to AI-generated code. Your updates should be concise, documented, and to the point.
- **Don't**: refactor large parts of the codebase at once, or replace well-maintained libraries with AI-generated
  helpers (unless you thoroughly review them)
